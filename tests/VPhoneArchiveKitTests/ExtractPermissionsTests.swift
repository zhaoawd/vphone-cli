/// There are two answers and they are opposites, which is the whole reason
/// these exist. `ontoGuestVolume` restores the archive's modes verbatim,

/// `intoHostDirectory` does not, because the archive came from somewhere else
/// and the files land in the user's home directory.

/// `vm import` shelled out to `/usr/bin/tar -xf` — no `-p` — for its whole
/// life, so it always had the second behaviour. When the shell-out became a
/// libarchive call, `ARCHIVE_EXTRACT_PERM` was set unconditionally and the
/// behaviour silently became the first. That is what these pin.
