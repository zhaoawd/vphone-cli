// MARK: - Thread-local UTF-8 LC_CTYPE

/// Runs one synchronous libarchive session with a UTF-8 LC_CTYPE on the
/// calling thread.
///
/// Adapted from upstream vphone-cli 7f746eed
/// (`VPhoneKit/VPhoneArchiveKit/Archive/VPhoneArchiveLocale.swift`).
///
/// libarchive converts member names and link targets between the archive's
/// charset and the thread's LC_CTYPE codeset. Nothing in vphone-cli calls
/// setlocale(3), so the process runs in "C", whose codeset is US-ASCII. There
/// a zip entry with the UTF-8 flag or a pax path with non-ASCII characters
/// comes back with a NULL pathname and ARCHIVE_WARN, and the pax writer
/// refuses the header ("Can't translate pathname").
///
/// uselocale(3) scopes the change to this thread and to `body`; setlocale(3)
/// would change it for every thread in the process. The other categories are
/// copied from the thread's current locale, so only LC_CTYPE changes. The
/// previous locale is restored when `body` returns or throws.
