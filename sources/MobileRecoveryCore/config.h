/*
 * config.h
 *
 * Hand-written stand-in for the config.h that libirecovery's autotools build
 * generates. It is NOT an upstream file: everything else under this target is
 * libirecovery byte for byte, and this is the one file SwiftPM has to supply
 * in autoconf's place.
 *
 * The vendored source is upstream `master`, not the 1.3.1 release. That is
 * deliberate and load-bearing: 1.3.1's device table has no entry for the PCC
 * research environment, so `irecv_devices_get_device_by_client` returned
 * nothing for it and idevicerestore stopped at "Unable to discover device
 * type" — the vphone VM was unrestorable. master carries
 *
 *     { "iPhone99,11", "vresearch101ap", 0x90, 0xFE01, "iPhone 99,11" },
 *
 * under a "Private Cloud Compute Research Environment" heading. The version
 * strings below stay at 1.3.1 because that is the last tag master descends
 * from, and it is what upstream's own configure.ac would still report.
 *
 * Each value below is what `./configure` would have written on macOS, read off
 * upstream's configure.ac and config.h.in rather than guessed:
 *
 *   - CoreFoundation/CoreFoundation.h and IOKit/usb/IOUSBLib.h are both present
 *     in the macOS SDK, so configure takes the `darwin*` branch, sets
 *     have_iokit=yes, defaults --with-iokit to yes and defines HAVE_IOKIT. That
 *     is the IOKit USB backend; libusb is never reached and is not a dependency
 *     of this package.
 *   - USE_DUMMY stays undefined (--with-dummy defaults to no), or every
 *     transfer would compile down to IRECV_E_UNSUPPORTED.
 *   - BUILD_TOOLS and HAVE_READLINE stay undefined: tools/irecovery.c is not
 *     vendored, only src/libirecovery.c.
 *   - The HAVE_*_H / HAVE_<func> entries are the AC_CHECK_HEADERS and
 *     AC_CHECK_FUNCS lists from configure.ac, all of which hold on macOS.
 *   - AC_SYS_LARGEFILE defines nothing here: off_t is already 64-bit on macOS,
 *     so no _FILE_OFFSET_BITS / _LARGE_FILES.
 *   - The `const`, `size_t`, `ssize_t` and `uint{8,16,32}_t` fallbacks in
 *     config.h.in are for pre-C89 and Solaris hosts and stay undefined.
 *   - LT_OBJDIR is libtool's, and there is no libtool here.
 *
 * This target is built as a static library and linked into the executables of
 * this package, which is upstream's `--enable-static --disable-shared` case, so
 * IRECV_STATIC is defined too — in Package.swift, because libirecovery.h needs
 * it as well and this header is private to the target.
