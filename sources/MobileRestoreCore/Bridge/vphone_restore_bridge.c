/*
 * vphone_restore_bridge.c
 *
 * What stands in for upstream's main(). NOT an upstream file.
 *
 * src/idevicerestore.c is compiled with IDEVICERESTORE_NOMAIN, so everything
 * below its `#ifndef IDEVICERESTORE_NOMAIN` guard — argv parsing, the usage
 * text, the SIGINT handler and main() itself — is gone, and this file builds
 * the same struct idevicerestore_client_t from a struct instead. Read
 * vphone_restore_bridge.h for the caller's side of the contract.
 *
 * Three things here are worth reading before changing anything:
 *
 *   1. The offline ticket. Upstream's -T/--ticket is NOT what this bridge's
 *      `ticket_path` does, and it cannot be — see "THE OFFLINE TICKET" below.
 *   2. The log plumbing. idevicerestore writes to two places, a levelled
 *      logger() and plain printf(), and both have to end up at one callback.
 *   3. Process-global state. idevicerestore keeps the log level, the debug
 *      flag and the quit flag in globals, so only one restore can run at a
 *      time and vphone_restore_run() enforces that.

/* --- THE OFFLINE TICKET ------------------------------------------------ */

/*
 * `ticket_path` is NOT upstream's -T/--ticket, and this is the one place in
 * this target where an upstream file is patched rather than copied. Both
 * halves of that deserve the explanation.
 *
 * What -T does, in this exact snapshot of src/idevicerestore.c:
 *
 *   - line 1966-1974, in main()'s getopt loop: read_file(optarg, …) into
 *     client->root_ticket / client->root_ticket_len. Raw bytes, no parsing.
 *   - line 1281-1292, in idevicerestore_start(): if the device is already in
 *     restore mode, wrap those bytes in a PLIST_DATA node, build a BRAND NEW
 *     one-key dict, and assign it to client->tss:
 *
 *         client->tss = plist_new_dict();
 *         plist_dict_set_item(client->tss, "ApImg4Ticket", ap_ticket);
 *
 * So -T's client->tss holds the AP ticket and nothing else. A real TSS
 * response is a dict with an entry PER COMPONENT — iBEC, iBoot, SEP, the
 * kernelcache and the rest — each carrying that component's Blob/signature,
 * and personalize_component() looks its component up in client->tss by name.
 * With -T there is nothing to look up, so every component personalizes
 * without its signature and the device rejects it. -T is for the narrow case
 * where a device is already in restore mode and only the AP ticket is still
 * needed; it is not an offline restore.
 *
 * The backend this replaces, pymobiledevice3, passed the whole response
 * plist: `Restore(ipsw, device, tss=tss, …)` where tss came straight from
 * `fetch_tss_record()`. That is what scripts/pymobiledevice3_bridge.py's
 * --tss option carried, and it is what `make restore_offline` feeds from the
 * .shsh file that `make restore_get_shsh` wrote. So the bridge has to install
 * the full response as client->tss, not a bare ticket.
 *
 * There is no seam in upstream for that. client->tss is written in exactly
 * four places: the -T block above, and three calls to get_tss_response()
 * (idevicerestore.c:1294 and :1513, dfu.c:520), each of which passes
 * &client->tss. Pre-setting the field does not survive, because
 * get_tss_response() starts with `*tss = NULL;` (idevicerestore.c:2353), and
 * its own local-.shsh cache is reachable only when build_major <= 8 or
 * FLAG_CUSTOM is set — neither is true for a modern iPhone. Interposing the
 * symbol is not possible either: it is a plain static-library symbol that the
 * calling translation units resolve directly.
 *
 * So get_tss_response() carries a four-line hook at its top, marked `vphone:`
 * in idevicerestore.c, that calls the function below and returns early if it
 * fills the response. That is the ONLY edit to upstream code in this target.
 *
 * The hook fires for the main request only. All three call sites pass
 * &client->tss, and the one request that must still go to Apple — the
 * recovery-OS root ticket at idevicerestore.c:1316 — passes
 * &client->tss_recoveryos_root_ticket instead, so comparing the out-parameter
 * against &client->tss separates them exactly.
