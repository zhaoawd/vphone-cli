/*
 * vphone_restore_bridge.h
 *
 * The one public header of MobileRestoreCore, and the only thing in this
 * target's Include/ directory. Everything else here — idevicerestore's own
 * sources, config.h and the libzip stub — is private to the target, so a
 * Swift caller sees this file and nothing else.
 *
 * This is what stands in for upstream's main(): src/idevicerestore.c is
 * compiled with IDEVICERESTORE_NOMAIN, so its argv parsing, usage text and
 * signal handling are gone, and vphone_restore_run() below sets up the same
 * client object from a struct instead of from a command line.
 *
 * One restore at a time. idevicerestore keeps its mode, its log level and its
 * quit flag in process globals, so a second concurrent call would fight the
 * first over them; vphone_restore_run() refuses with
 * VPHONE_RESTORE_E_BUSY rather than letting that happen.
