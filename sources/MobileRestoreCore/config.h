/*
 * config.h
 *
 * Hand-written stand-in for the config.h that idevicerestore's autotools build
 * generates. It is NOT an upstream file: everything else under this target is
 * upstream's own source, and this is the one file SwiftPM has to supply in
 * autoconf's place. It lives beside the .c files rather than in Include/ for
 * the same reason MobileRecoveryCore's does — Include/ is this target's public
 * header directory and becomes the generated module's umbrella, and no
 * dependent should inherit a PACKAGE_VERSION it did not ask for. Two targets
 * in this package now carry a config.h, and if both were public they would
 * collide in any translation unit that imported both modules. For the same
 * reason both C targets build with USE_HEADERMAP = NO: Xcode's project header
 * map indexes every header in the project by bare name, so a quoted
 * "config.h" here (or in libimobiledevice-glue's termcolors.h) would resolve
 * to libirecovery's copy instead, and the two would be stacked in one unit.
 * `.headerSearchPath(".")` plus `.define("HAVE_CONFIG_H")` is what reaches it.
 *
 * Every value below is read off upstream's configure.ac rather than guessed:
 *
 *   - PKG_CHECK_MODULES only decides whether to build at all; it defines
 *     nothing. libirecovery is MobileRecoveryCore, and libimobiledevice, its
 *     glue, libplist, libusbmuxd and libtatsu come from the
 *     AppleMobileDeviceLibrary xcframeworks. zlib and libcurl are the system
 *     ones in /usr/lib. libzip is the exception — see zip.h.
 *   - AC_CHECK_FUNCS([strsep strcspn mkstemp realpath]) — all four are in libc
 *     on macOS, so all four are defined. That is also what keeps common.c's
 *     own strsep()/realpath() fallbacks compiled out.
 *   - The `darwin*` arm of the host_os case defines _DARWIN_BETTER_REALPATH.
 *   - The four AC_CACHE_CHECK compile tests all pass against the
 *     libimobiledevice 1.4.0 headers this package links: IDEVICE_E_TIMEOUT is
 *     in libimobiledevice.h, RESTORE_E_RECEIVE_TIMEOUT in restore.h, `enum
 *     idevice_connection_type` in libimobiledevice.h, and reverse_proxy.h
 *     declares reverse_proxy_client_create_with_port.
 *   - --with-limera1n defaults to yes, so HAVE_LIMERA1N is defined and
 *     limera1n.c is part of the target, exactly as in an upstream build.
 *   - AC_CHECK_HEADER(endian.h) fails on macOS, which is why configure would
 *     define __LITTLE_ENDIAN/__BIG_ENDIAN/__BYTE_ORDER itself. Those are NOT
 *     defined here: endianness.h already supplies the identical values behind
 *     its own #ifndef guards, and clang defines __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ on every
 *     Apple target, so __BYTE_ORDER resolves the same way. Defining them here
 *     would only risk a clash with Darwin's <machine/endian.h>.
 *   - AC_SYS_LARGEFILE defines nothing: off_t is already 64-bit on macOS.
 *   - WIN32, LT_OBJDIR and the Windows/mingw fallbacks stay undefined.
 *
 * Two entries are this package's rather than autoconf's, both marked below:
 * IDEVICERESTORE_NOMAIN and HAVE_LOCALTIME_R.

 * Version. configure gets this from git-version-gen, which needs either a git
